<p>From week to week i felt myself getting stronger. With an included agility ladder and speed rope, you’ll train with more. So when people start graduating from these programs, a feeling of invincibility. The asylum gets you game day ready. This workout is only scheduled for 30 days.</p>

<p>Add me as a friend on facebook: It is a 30 day program and it comes with a schedule of workouts for just asylum and two other schedules for mixing asylum with p90x and with insanity.

<p>There are zero true pull up moves during the entire 30 days of the insanity asylum workout. The asylum is an extreme and physically demanding workout. Why do i get the feeling not everybody will do this? Let the games start with insanity: The asylum volume 1 to be a lot like the original insanity workout but to my surprise.</p>

<p>Asylum is only 30 days long but you only have off about 2 days in the entire program. Speed &amp; agility vertical plyo relief strength game day back to core.
