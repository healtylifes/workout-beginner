RPE Explained The Rated Perceived Exertion Scale From pinterest.com</p>
<p>This chapter concerns the rate of perceived exertion (rpe) system in reactive training. If an rpe only program if is set up right and the lifter executes it reasonably well they shouldn’t be repeating the same workout for that long anyway. Pay attention because if you don’t get this right, the entire system can be thrown off to a degree. While heart rate (hr) is a popular way to measure exercise intensity, we prefer ratings of perceived exertion (rpe) and will explain why in this post.</p>

Week 1 — 3 sets at rpe 7. Very light to light effort. This workout begins with an rpe 6 pace, transitions into several rpe 9 efforts, and finishes with what should feel like an rpe 4 cool down period. Week 4 — 3 sets at rpe 8. This is a 12 week powerlifting peaking program based on rate of perceived exertion (rpe).</p>

<p>Very light to light effort. Essentially, rpe is a rating of how close to failure you get after each set. It was created by matt mignone at mignone strength ( @mignonestrength) and is generally recommended for intermediate and advanced lifters. Squats 3×5 @8 rpe paused squat 3×4 @7 rpe. You could have done 2 more reps.</p>

<p>As the program progreses, 1 set of 20 turns into 1 set of 15 and finally into 1 set of 10. This is how a session of squats could be planned: Could definitely do 2 more reps, maybe 3. Week 2 — 4 sets at rpe 7. Below is an example of a workout in a training log.</p>

<p>Week 1 — 3 sets at rpe 7. Here is the most basic way of implementing rpe. You can also adjust your training intensity based on how you feel that day. For example, if rate of perceived exertion is 6 and the workout took 50 minutes to complete, the rpe load would be 300. This allows you to maintain solid.</p>

<p>If an rpe only program if is set up right and the lifter executes it reasonably well they shouldn’t be repeating the same workout for that long anyway. Rpe load is the rate of perceived exertion multiplied by the duration (in minutes) it took to complete the training load. If you are still confused on rpe, we have covered this.</p>

<p>Rpe—or the rate of perceived exertion—is a scale used to identify the intensity of your exercise based on how hard you feel (or perceive) your effort to be. Week 2 — 4 sets at rpe 7.
