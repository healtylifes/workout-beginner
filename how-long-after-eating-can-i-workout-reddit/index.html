<p>I�ve discovered that if i eat a trigger when i�m already flaring, it exacerbates things and hits me quicker. Eat these about one to three hours before exercising. The type and amount of carbohydrates you consume have a major impact on your ability to perform and recover. If you need a snack, the best foods before a cardio workout are carbohydrates like a granola bar or a banana.</p>
<h3 id="eat-these-at-least-three-to-four-hours-before-exercising">Eat these at least three to four hours before exercising.</h3><p>Eating too much before you exercise can leave you feeling sluggish. This is one of those things that you�re probably just gonna have to listen to your body for. For me, it�s usually within a couple hours after eating, depending on the trigger and whether or not i was already flaring. How long to wait to workout after eating as a general rule of thumb, you should wait to exercise until three to four hours after eating a meal, and one to two hours after eating a snack, advises. I personally eat my 800kcal breakfast, do the dishes, then head to the gym. But, if you need to eat closer to your workout (within about an hour, or so), it’s best to choose a simpler snack.</p>
