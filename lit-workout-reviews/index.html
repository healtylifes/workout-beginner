<h3 id="the-average-rating-it-received-across-2000-beyond-raw-lit-reviews-is-45-out-of-5-starsshockingly-impressive">The average rating it received across 2,000+ beyond raw lit reviews is 4.5 out of 5 stars…shockingly impressive.</h3><p>Personally, i’m very excited about this machine and predict that the lit method will only continue to grow and evolve, leaving users with a workout system that they can feel good about. When i take it, i feel smarter and more focused. Summary lit pre workout is a kind of pre workout that strives to do away with all the unnecessary herbs and extracts and just gets right into the whole training aspect. Quality ingredients, quality dosing, and effective synergy makes lit pre workout a good supplement to start with or to build a stack on. All in all, beyond raw lit is a great pre workout, with a decent energy complex, and a few good nootropics to boost cognition. It really falls short, so if you want great pumps, i urge you to look somewhere else.</p>
