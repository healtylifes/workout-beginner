<p>Personally, i can work out just fine early the morning before i�ve eaten anything provided that i haven�t been awake for more than an hour and i get right into my workout.

<p>Ideally, if you�re lifting weights after eating first thing in the morning, you will need to get up and chow down about 30 to 60 minutes before exercising. You should wait 2 hours after eating to exercise. How soon after your workout you need to eat depends on the intensity of your workout and ranges from 15 minutes to 2.</p>

<p>What duration would be most optimal? I was wondering how long you should wait after eating a meal before you can start working out? You should also consider the fact that exercising on an empty stomach is never a good idea. Knowing what foods to choose before a morning workout takes a bit of trial and error. When to eat.</p>

<p>What duration would be most optimal? After 15 minutes your breath and heart rate will be back at normal levels again, so it will be the perfect time to. Also, the greater the intensity of the exercise you are planning on doing the longer you should wait. If you need a snack, the best foods before a cardio workout are.</p>

<p>I personally eat my 800kcal breakfast, do the dishes, then head to the gym. If i am exercising at an unusual time, i try to just eat at the normal time and have a drink instead.

<p>If i’m eating big meal, like a whole dinner, i usually wait 1.5+ hours. In these cases, you should eat a snack that could replace the glycogen stores in your body quickly.

<p>I’ve been doing this for a couple weeks now (drinking a muscle milk) after workouts, and it makes me feel very nauseous.
