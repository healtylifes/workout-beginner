<p>This month not only does the intensity go up a bit the minutes of each workout go up a bit to 60 minutes each day. Throw in real heavy lift days at least once a week. A lot of month 2 intervals recruits your entire body. I felt like i was constantly doing push ups.</p>
<h3 id="month-2-for-me-never-got-easier-but-i-was-able-to-do-it-and-not-take-as-many-breaks-as-the-weeks-went-on">Month 2, for me, never got easier but i was able to do it and not take as many breaks as the weeks went on.</h3><p>That will be based on that first time going through it. Month 2 workouts seemed more resistance oriented than the month 1 workouts. The workouts are shorter on average in the beginning. Have gotten great results with fast &amp; slow twitch muscle. Started insanity 2 weeks ago and i have dropped a inch already in pants. Month 1 has its own list of workouts that you alternate between each week, while month 2 has similar yet more difficult versions of those same workouts.</p>

<p>The insanity “success stories” are pretty damn convincing. This month not only does the intensity go up a bit the minutes of each workout go up a bit to 60 minutes each day. Still had a little fat around stomach. This was a hard month. Encourage yourself and take it one interval at a time.one.</p>

We both used to regularly lift weights in the gym, about 4 days per week, but have had to stop when our gym closed during the pandemic.

<p>This is my first time ever doing insanity, but my boyfriend�s second (it�s been a while). The insanity calendar is split into two months with a recovery week in between.

<p>The schedule allows for one rest day per week and one cardio recovery day. Now, i still have about 30 lbs to lose and i don’t know which program to do. The truth is that it’s not. The insanity workout are tough, but it will still take some until you see any results at all. Of course some results are.</p>
