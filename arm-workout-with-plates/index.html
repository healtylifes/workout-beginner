<p>A weight plate can be a versatile piece of equipment. Also, supinating the hands into a more neutral position helps teach the neuromuscular system to pull the scapula medially. Twist the shoulders and plate in the direction of the front leg, contracting your core. Watch this video to get inspired with more ways to use it!</p>
<h3 id="raise-the-plate-up-from-your-waist-to-your-shoulders-then-explode-upwards-into-a-press">Raise the plate up from your waist to your shoulders then explode upwards into a press.</h3><p>With the right plan and the right discipline, you can get seriously shredded in just 28 days. Regardless of the type of power rack or lever arms you have, you should have several pin holes to set your lever arms to. With kettlebells, the hands tend to move naturally and rhythmically, whereas plates have to be essentially manhandled in order to control them properly. Repeat this for four sets, then move on to exercise 2. Pinch down hard to keep the plates from moving, and curl the plates upward until they are just in front of your shoulder. Hold two weight plates together with a pinch grip.</p>
