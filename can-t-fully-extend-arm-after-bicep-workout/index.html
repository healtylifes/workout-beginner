<p>However there’s no need to worry, this is very common. I did pullups with my trainer on monday. Adjust the amount of support under the forearm if necessary.

<p>Just like any other body part, the muscles in the arms can’t grow without stretching the tough connective tissue, called fascia, in which your muscles are enclosed. Adjust the amount of support under the forearm if necessary. This happened to me a couple weeks ago after bicep curls. Use your other hand to bend your wrist further, gently, so that.</p>

<p>Extreme exercise can actually cause cell death of the muscles. Ultimately, you can�t straighten your elbow because the muscle and connective tissue are locked tight and won�t give you the range of motion. I�ve had the same thing and occasionally get a client who gets really bad doms that they can�t fully extend their arms. This is day 2 since.</p>

<p>Brickner says that this is a sign of rhabdomyolysis, a severe injury to the muscles from an excessive workout. Basically i�m unable to let my arms casually straight next to my body, i almost can�t even put on a tshirtby myself. I have never had this kind of swelling with any workout but i do realize i�m starting a more.</p>

<p>My arm can�t fully extend after lifting weights (very very light workout). I can�t totally straighten my arms, and i noticed today that my biceps are quite swollen and feel rock hard.

<p>They were so swollen i couldn�t fully extend my arm straight. It happens because of swollen muscle tissue cause pressure on the connective tissue that surrounds the muscle.

If this is the case, it might be helpful for you to know how to stretch your bicep tendon before and after working out. Basically.</p>

<p>This is day 2 since working out. Lie on the floor “face upwards” and place a pillow under your forearm so that your arm may rest with a slight amount of stretch. Why can’t i fully extend my arm?

<p>This can result in unnatural pain that prevents you from straightening your arm after a bicep workout. Best thing i can suggest when people get back into lifting is to work on muscular endurance for a couple weeks before anything else. Slowly progress your workouts so your muscles are able to adapt, recover and grow back stronger between each lifting.</p>
