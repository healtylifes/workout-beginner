<p>A 2012 study posted in the journal of strength conditioning and resistance found that men who took caffeine supplements were able to do heavier lifting at greater weights than men who were given a placebo. Another study in 2014 claimed that while performance and gains did not differ between the supplement and the placebo groups, the supplement group were able to perform. No improvements were observed in upper and lower body power or upper body strength. In the control condition, no pill was given.</p>
<h3 id="no-improvements-were-observed-in-upper-and-lower-body-power-or-upper-body-strength">No improvements were observed in upper and lower body power or upper body strength.</h3><p>Subjects were randomly provided either a placebo (p) or a supplement (s: Try some products of the following site and this will be your turning point of make believe. Or c4, but other times i don�t feel it at all. Exercise, independent of actual exercise, would be expected to result in subsequent health beneﬁts (a placebo effect). If the placebo effect alone is letting you crank out some extra reps or get you to a higher weight then it�s doing a great job as a pre workout. People wanting to know if it�s just placebo or not sound, to me, like they�re looking for an excuse to avoid exercise.</p>
