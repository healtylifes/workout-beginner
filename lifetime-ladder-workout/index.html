<p>A ladder workout is a method of strength and sports training where you perform one or more exercises with an ascending and descending repetition pattern. Stand upright with your legs apart, hands outstretched above your head. Over time, a steady routine of moderate to intense climbing activity will result in weight loss. This type of exercise also can raise your metabolic rate long past your workout.</p>
<h3 id="completing-all-the-exercises-typically-takes-between-10-and-15-minutes">Completing all the exercises typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes.</h3><p>The exercises in the lifetime ladder are sufficiently demanding that if you�re seriously out of shape you may not be able to do a single one when you begin the exercise program at rung 1 of the introductory ladder. The ladder technique is a powerful way to increase your strength, pack on muscle and if used with an aggressive pace, you will also improve cardio and stimulate fat loss. All you have to do is repetitions of basic exercises such as push ups, leg lifts and steps. Pack all the gear in its carrying bag to store when done. This compensates for the increased difficulty of the exercises in the lifetime ladder and should make the transition no more difficult than between any two other rungs. If this is your first time doing agility ladder drills for lacrosse, we’ll start with the basics on how to use one and the proper form.</p>
