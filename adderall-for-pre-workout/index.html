<h3 id="although-the-practice-may-be-counterproductive-in-some-circumstances-it039s-downright-dangerous-if-you039re-taking-adderall">Although the practice may be counterproductive in some circumstances, it�s downright dangerous if you�re taking adderall.</h3><p>If taken, zinc should be dosed at 15 to 30 mg per day for men, or 10 to 20 for women.
