Cellucor C4 Extreme is transparent and free of artificial From stack3d.com</p>
<p>Can of red bull has 80mg of caffeine, which is about the same as a cup of coffee and twice as much as a 12 oz. I�ve noticed the same issue, but it�s to be expected since c4 has 150mg of caffeine which is basically a cup of coffee and i don�t normally drink coffee so my caffeine tolerance doesn�t exist. This supplement can be taken about 20 to 30 minutes before your workout to enhance performance, mental focus, and explosiveness. C4 energy drinks were released in 2018 by nutrabolt, the same manufacturer that also launched cellucor and rebranded xtend.</p>
