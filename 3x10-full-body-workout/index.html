<p>3 sets x 10 reps; 3 sets x 10 reps 3 sets x 10 reps; Let�s say you�re in your first year of training, and last week you pressed 115 pounds for 3x10.</p>
<h3 id="youre-afraid-that-doing-straight-sets-will-cause-you">You’re afraid that doing straight sets will cause you.</h3><p>You will be training the legs, chest, back, shoulders, triceps, biceps, calves and abs all in one training session. Should you perform cardio on your rest days? 3 sets x 10 reps If you’ve been struggling to see solid results with a typical bodypart split routine (if you’re not on anabolic steroids why train like someone that is?), give this john grimek programme a go. Next week, probably 125 for 3x10. It does this by programming compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously.</p>
