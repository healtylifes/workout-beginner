<h3 id="the-more-water-you-drink-the-less-water-your-body-stores">The more water you drink, the less water your body stores.</h3><p>Adderall, even when taken as prescribed, can be harmful when combined with other stimulants. Also, don�t do cardio or anything that puts a strong strain on the heart. 5�9/178/11% aren�d bad #�s for a prescription med highly frowned upon. Stop trying to scare him, he�ll be fine.
