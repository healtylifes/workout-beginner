Resistance Band Workout For Women At Home Workout From pinterest.co.uk</p>
<p>Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull your elbows straight back as far as possible against the resistance of the band. Hold onto each end of the loop. The resistance band deadlift is the “king” of all resistance band exercises. Squat down until your knee is about an inch from the ground.</p>
<h3 id="put-the-band-around-both-feet-with-your-feet-facing-forward">Put the band around both feet with your feet facing forward.</h3><p>Stick your butt out—it�s like you�re in a deadlift position. This most closely replicates a hex bar deadlift or a rack pull. Now, keeping your back straight, push your hips forward, and stand upright. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull your elbows straight back as far as possible against the resistance of the band. Hold this for 30 seconds, then switch. Arms should be straight out in front of you.</p>
