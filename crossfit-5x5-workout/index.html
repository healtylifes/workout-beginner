<p>Started crossfitting, then tacked on 5x5 to add some focus to strength training. I personally have been implementing a 5x5 schedule in my workouts.

<p>Madcow�s version of the 5x5 is without a doubt, the best 5x5 protocol to date. 5x5 squats, 5x5 bench, 3x10 strict pull ups, 3x10 weighted abs thurs: Each workout focuses on three out of the five compound exercises. Whenever you break, do the bike cals. Ill give this a try atm i do a 3 day strength training mon thurs.</p>

<p>Everyone should do the lat pull downs. Crossfit five by five is here to help you become better. Started crossfitting, then tacked on 5x5 to add some focus to strength training. Stronglifts 5x5 minimizes risks of injury by enforcing correct exercise technique. Use a single dumbbell on the snatches and a pair for the thrusters.</p>

<p>All my 5x5 workouts are for core strength.
