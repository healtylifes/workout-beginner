<p>It looks like lit af is a product with a good set of pump enhancing ingredients in it. Lit does have artificial flavors and sweeteners but apparently, beyond raw has done a good job with their flavors and taste in general.

<p>Or perhaps you always feel like your energy levels start to slow down after just a few minutes of some somewhat regular workouts? On the whole, this isn’t the best pre workout on the market.
