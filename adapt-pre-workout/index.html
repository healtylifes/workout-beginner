A strong pre workout drink for people who go to the gym and workout, even if you workout at home. Its taken all the research performed on hundreds of ingredients over the last 5 years, often released as a one or two ingredient pre workout formula, and packed 16 ingredients, all at effective dosage levels, into one massively amazing training supplement.

So the goal is to have your feet out wide to a comfortable level, (you shouldn’t experience any kind of sharp pain in any of your joints, and if you do, you need to get it evaluated by a medical professional).
