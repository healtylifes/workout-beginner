Interval Train at Every Level High intensity interval From pinterest.com</p>
<p>Hiit is particularly effective for weight loss and increasing cardiovascular fitness. If you think you�re working hard, your heart rate is probably higher than usual. What about the actual acronym of what’s being said though? Hiit is a unimodal method of training, meaning that it incorporates one type of movement, for example, running, cycling, burpees, or jumping jacks.</p>
<h3 id="so-the-goal-of-high-intensity-training-workouts-is-to-increase-exercise-intensity-in-order-to-induce-muscle-growth">So the goal of high intensity training workouts is to increase exercise intensity in order to induce muscle growth.</h3><p>Physical activity is important for people of all ages to maintain and improve health, and research has shown that active people are at a lower risk for premature death. The training focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure. It is essentially aerobic/cardiovascular training for short bursts of time. Perceived exertion may not always be similar to your heart rate level, and it depends on the individual. When most people mention the acronym hit, the assumption is that they are referring to high intensity interval training; It’s 2022 and high time we expand our definition of what “cardio” exercise is.</p>
