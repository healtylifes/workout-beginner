<p>That said, when it comes to burning calories a vertical climber is slightly better than elliptical machines. Linked below are several training programs that i’m making available for free download (for personal use only) to readers of my two new books, training for climbing (3rd edition) and the rock climber’s exercise guide.these programs are supplements to the material presented in these books—please read the books for detailed instruction on proper exercise. If you have to fit in a late workout, can’t leave the kids home alone, don’t want to drive 20 minutes for a workout, or are too cold to leave the house, you don’t have to worry. Increase your pace slightly higher.</p>
<h3 id="at-a-pace-of-130-feetmin">At a pace of 130 feet/min.</h3><p>Use your vertical climber for 15 seconds and then do 5 burpees for a total of 15 minutes alternating. If you use a vertical climber, you do not need to do any extra workout. The idea is to do a mix of short and long strokes and vary your range, speed and resistance. Increase your pace slightly higher. I definitely miss it but its a tough cardio workout. Well, it comes with a fitness app that helps you track your workout as you go, something you don�t find often when it comes to.</p>
