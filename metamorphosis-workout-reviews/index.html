<p>In fact, i was 15 lbs overweight. Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 workouts. Metamorphosis is based on solid principles and most of the feedback that has come in on it has been positive. I love this workout and the music helped me to really get into it.</p>
<h3 id="i-love-this-workout-and-the-music-helped-me-to-really-get-into-it">I love this workout and the music helped me to really get into it.</h3><p>Here�s my take on the fourth level of the tracy anderson method metamorphosis workout series for an omnicentric body. :) this time i’m reviewing one of tracy anderson’s programs called ta online studio and i’m excited to share more about this popular program with you! I designed metamorphosis so that you will never plateau and you will own your new body and progress at the end. Being relatively fit but not necessarily skilled in this particular style of workout, i chose the intermediate level. The third dvd was my favorite in the series. I love this workout and the music helped me to really get into it.</p>
