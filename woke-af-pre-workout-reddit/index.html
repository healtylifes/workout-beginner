<p>I think legions pre workout has a little more of all 3. Woke af has dendrobium and synephrine for high stimulant energy. Everything is the same other than those two ingredients. Woke af pre workout stimulant heavy pre workout powder for energy, pump and focus* 333 mg of caffeine, added theobromine and huperzine for an extra boost* 9.0 out of.</p>

<p>Blue raz, blood raz, grape, rocket pop. Woke af, gorilla mode, bamf, total war are solid choices if you�re looking for relatively high stims/good pump. The rest of the ingredients look to.
