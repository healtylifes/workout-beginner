<h3 id="8min--100--of-5k-pace">8min @ 100 % of 5k pace.</h3><p>As workouts go, threshold running is one of the most important and effective training methods you can do if you are looking to improve and sustain your speed over any distance. 5min from 65 to 80 % of 5k pace. A threshold or tempo run is a specific workout wherein you run at and above your lactate threshold in order to improve your fitness. As above, but your repetitions are slightly faster than your lactate threshold (you are “dipping your toes into anaerobic waters”) with slightly shorter recovery. Threshold runs are a great way to gain aerobic fitness, and they are a cornerstone workout for all distances, from 5k to the marathon. There are few workouts that raise your lactic acid levels more than 1 minute lactate builders.</p>
