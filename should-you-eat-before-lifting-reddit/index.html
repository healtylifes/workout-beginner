<p>I aim to have had at least one meal in me (on any given day) before training with weights so that i have adequate blood sugar to use. Eating a full meal an hour or two before the gym is a fantastic way of supplying energy during your workout. As for me, i like having a very watery protein shake.</p>

<p>I personally eat my 800kcal breakfast, do the dishes, then head to the gym. If you are on a diet, you may lose fat slower. Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass. As for me, i like having a very watery protein shake before my workouts, especially on leg day so that the muscles are rebuilding.</p>

<p>On the opposite, if you eat so much that you get sleepy or have gastric problems during your workout, you just ate too.

<p>If i want to maintain muscle mass in a calorie deficit, how many grams of protein should i aim for each day to eventually get to ~20% bf? Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass. Eat the right amount of protein over the course of the day, and chances are you will absorb most of it.</p>

<p>As for me, i like having a very watery protein shake before my workouts, especially on leg day so that the muscles are rebuilding as they are breaking. If it helps you can take your tdee and multiply it by 7. Usually, this happens if you have a physical job just before working out then going for a 2h workout,.</p>
