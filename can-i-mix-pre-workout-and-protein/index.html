<p>Protein plays an important role in repairing and rebuilding your muscles after exercise, and many people use protein shakes after their workouts to aid this process. So, on the other hand, if the protein you�re taking is poor quality or it has less than 20 grams of protein, it may be a good idea to add supplemental bcaas or eaas to the protein, basically so you can get that leucine value back up to 2.5 to 3 grams. Finally, the main thing to note when it comes to these supplements is that it is usually okay to use the two together as a supplement to your training. Worrying about the speed of absorption is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Glutamine is useless if you eat enough protein. If you are working out and are fasted, then timing can matter. Creatine can be mixed with grape juice. It�ll give you a jolt of energy before you exercise. Bcaas are useless if you eat enough protein, except perhaps when fasted training.</p>
