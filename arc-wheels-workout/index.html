<h3 id="a-key-mistake-people-make-when-using-the-exercise-wheel-is-letting-the-lower-back-change-arch-or-change-its-alignment">A key mistake people make when using the exercise wheel is letting the lower back change arch or change its alignment.</h3><p>Planet fitness workout machines list. If your lower back arches during the rollout, stop the exercise. Roll forward and drop your chest toward the floor with straight arms until your reach your full range of motion. You can use a stability ball for the easier version, or the wheel for the more advanced version.
