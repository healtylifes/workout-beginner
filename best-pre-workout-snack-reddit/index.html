Best PreWorkout Snacks for Morning Exercise From mensjournal.com</p>
<p>Peanut butter banana honey sandwich: Carbs and protein are best. While carbs get broken down into glucose (the energy your body uses during exercise) or are stored as glycogen, which your body also taps into during exercise. In the body, potassium is only stored for a limited amount of time, so try consuming a banana around 30 minutes to an hour before your workout.</p>

Spread 2 tbsp of peanut butter on two slices of whole grain bread. However, a glass of milk can give you the protein boost you need if you’re low on snacks and time. My favorite sources are rice milk (tastes great with whey protein!) and bananas, but other popular nutritious choices are instant oatmeal, dates and figs, melon, white potato, white rice, raisins, and sweet potato. I would do coffee but i can’t really leave school and i have a tolerance to it. Oats because they are full of fiber, oats release carbohydrates gradually.</p>

<p>Oats because they are full of fiber, oats release carbohydrates gradually. Bananas known as nature’s power bar, bananas are packed with carbohydrates and potassium, which supports nerve and muscle function. I like to have an apple and a rice cake currently, or i’ll do a hard boiled egg or a banana. Any product that is mostly dextrose is really good.</p>

<p>Bananas bananas are a great source of natural sugars, simple carbohydrates, and potassium. In the body, potassium is only stored for a limited amount of time, so try consuming a banana around 30 minutes to an hour before your workout.
