<p>The sport review) it tasted pretty good. Tatse it really nice and is so convenient first thing in a morning to take to bed and have as soon as i wake at 5am for my morning workout! The taste sometimes means cordial is required. Good buzz and energy from it but flavour is absolutely disgusting, even for a pre workout,.</p>

<p>My protein pre workouts suck. Good buzz and energy from it but flavour is absolutely disgusting, even for a pre workout, little green bits floating around in it after mixing, horrible aftertaste. Is it worth its popularity? Taste is a bit strong but ok and can tend to be a bit grainy. Definitely helps with longer gym performance and would.</p>

<p>The myprotein mypre pre workout formula grade is 7.8. I am not a big pre workout guy but jp nutrition looks one of the best. But that’s not to say it’s perfect. Really like the pre workout gel in the blue berry flavour. My protein pre workouts suck.</p>

<p>As a pre workout it works okay, i haven’t noticed too much effect using this product before a workout, however the taste makes it almost impossible to drink. What is in myprotein my pre pre workout? The flavours are amazing and it gives off a great amount of energy. Can feel the effects around 10 minutes after taking and lasts.</p>

<p>I would say trained by jp would be the uk version of gorilla. But that’s not to say it’s perfect. Read genuine and unbiased product reviews from our customers.
