I bench, squat, leg curl, calf press, lateral raise, do chin ups, do several ab exercises.</p>

<p>I�m writting up a new workout routine currently and was thinking it would be a lot more beneficial for me to workout only on the weekdays as at the weekends i normally go out drinking and such. Shrugs only 2 times a week. What i learned from exercising 100 days in a row… it actually takes less discipline. This workout.</p>

<p>Can also be used as a general strength building routine, or as preparation/conditioning for a more advanced full body approach. Even more importantly, every body part is trained twice per week, which is the optimal training frequency for most people, and it does so in a way that allows.

<p>Yo, was just wondering if it�s alright to workout 5 days in a row (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday &amp; friday) and then taking the weekends as rest days. It is possible to train 4 days in a row working the same muscles. Shoulder &amp; arms day 5: Doing these exercises 2 days in a row is unnecessary. Also do lower.</p>

<p>If you have decided to do full body workouts, there are only a handful exercises you need to do. It is possible to train 4 days in a row working the same muscles. I bench, squat, leg curl, calf press, lateral raise, do chin ups, do several ab exercises and row every day. 5 day split example 1: Even more.</p>

<p>At friday i�m extra tired after training, i feel the muscles but there is no pain. As i write this, i’m on about day number 125. Dumbbells on day 1, cables on day 2, barbells on day 3, machines on day 4, and dumbbells again on day 5 (but with different exercises). I recently started training 5 instead of 3.</p>

<p>That is, if you train on monday, you’ll have tuesday off, then train again on wednesday. The catch is fatigue management. Each of the five workouts focuses on a different piece of equipment: For a three day schedule, consider doing a full body workout on monday, wednesday and friday or tuesday, thursday and saturday. Nevertheless, as the weeks go by.</p>
