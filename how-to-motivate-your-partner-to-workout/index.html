<p>Nagging your partner to exercise is likely to backfire. If your friend wants to get their spouse or partner to workout too, make it a foursome for added fun (make sure that the spouses are friends before you commit). Once you get clear on what you want then you need to have a specific and meaningful reason behind your workouts that goes beyond motivation. Before you try to convince your partner (or anyone, for that matter) to exercise more often, read these important tips on how to clarify your own intentions and gently encourage more activity without potentially damaging.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-should-be-fun-and-invigorating-and-make-your-boyfriend-feel-good-about-himself">Exercise should be fun and invigorating and make your boyfriend feel good about himself.</h3><p>If food tends to be a reliable motivator for your partner, agree on a plan to stop for a smoothie or healthy lunch on the way home, or pack a nutritious picnic in an insulated backpack to enjoy after your activity. Be a good role model. Get your workout clothes out the night before so you‚Äôre ready to go as soon as you get up. Offer a compliment when your significant other exercises. Lack of time help client plan, organize and prioritize exercise. Keep a friend motivated by acknowledging the hard work sheÔøΩs putting into her fitness regimen.</p>
