In general the more often you work them, the fewer exercises. If you cannot hold this position for one minute without falling forward, your glutes are not working properly. Glutes (activators) *it doesn’t matter that the exercises i do for chest, back, and arms are activators or stretchers as they are a different muscle group so are already well rested. That’s the perfect time to start 4 weeks training the glutes 6 times per week, then go back to a reduced frequency.
