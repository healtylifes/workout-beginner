<p>I took 2 scoops of jack3d then 30 minutes later took some dark rage, i was working out, got dizzy, sweating profusely, almost threw up and felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. When i get home and sometimes towards the end of my workout i feel crazy tired and my veins start to feel weird. So i just started taking dark rage. The truth is that a pump is the result of delivering more blood to muscle tissue, so while the use of nitric oxide (no) stimulating ingredients like aakg and arginine can be effective by causing.</p>
