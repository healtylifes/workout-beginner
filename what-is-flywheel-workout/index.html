<p>Their role and importance on a spin bike. The flywheel is the large, round metal disk on a spin bike. The rider begins pedalling and the flywheel starts spinning. The role of a flywheel on a spin bike is to provide resistance for you to peddle against.</p>
<h3 id="the-heavier-the-flywheel-the-harder-its-going-to-be-to-pedal-and-thus-the-greater-the-resistance-will-be">The heavier the flywheel, the harder it’s going to be to pedal and thus the greater the resistance will be.</h3><p>You can get a good cardio workout from either class. What does a flywheel do on an exercise bike? The exercise bike flywheel weight is the most important of all the specifications. It’s the exercise technique in receiving the load that is truly an increased eccentric muscle action. Flywheels are not eccentric overload machines that increase the force beyond the concentric contribution from the athlete. The inertia resulting from the size and number of flywheels impacts the training adaptation you get.</p>
