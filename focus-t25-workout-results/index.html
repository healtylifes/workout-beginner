<p>Lee packed on the muscle. Alpha (foundation), beta (core), and gamma (strength). The reason is that your body continues to burn calories even after the workout is over! Not too long ago, i wrote about my (confusing) introduction to focus t25 , the exercise program designed by insanity creator shaun t.</p>
<h3 id="according-to-shaun-t-the-hardest-t25-workout-is-the-alpha-total-body-circuit">According to shaun t, the hardest t25 workout is the alpha total body circuit.</h3><p>I loved that it was an intense workout that only took 25 minutes per day, but sometimes i just didn’t want to do it. The workout features no rest breaks and ends strong on an absolutely brutal “burnout” set. Honest thoughts on focus t25. I am just starting week 3 of focus t25 alpha and so far i�ve seen incredible results! After the focus t25 workouts you’ll be able to take on any physical activity!
