<p>Interval training is simply alternating short bursts (about 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (about 1 to 2 minutes) of less intense activity. Hiit is primarily applied utilizing aerobic exercise, such as a running on a treadmill and cycling on an ergometer [1,2]. This allows you to work more in a shorter period of time and it�s much more comfortable than spending the entire workout at a high intensity. Interval training is simply alternating short bursts (about 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (about 1 to 2 minutes) of less intense activity.</p>
<h3 id="there039s-a-lot-more-to-high-intensity-interval-training-than-its-name-alone-suggests">There�s a lot more to high intensity interval training than its name alone suggests.</h3><p>A prospective study of healthy men and women. This type of training involves repeated bouts of high intensity effort followed by varied recovery times. Originally called fartlek (a swedish term meaning “speed play”), interval training combines alternating short and fast bursts of intense exercise with slower, easier activity. For instance, if your exercise is walking and you�re in good shape, you might add short bursts of jogging into your regular brisk walks. A complete interval training program usually comprises several short, alternating periods of both higher and lower intensity exercises. If you�re overtraining, intervals can tax your cns and cause muscle damage, mechanical tension, and metabolic stress.</p>
