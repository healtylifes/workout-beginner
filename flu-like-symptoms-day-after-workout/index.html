<p>However, i drank a lot of fluids and still felt bad the next day. I usually run for about 30 mins, stretch, then lift. Sleep is basically where the majority of your repair is going to.

<p>Also my legs got very tight (i have pretty good flexibility but now it’s very painful when i try to touch my toes with my hands). The second day right after working out i felt.
