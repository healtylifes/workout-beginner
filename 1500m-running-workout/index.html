<p>Most distance events are, but the 1500m is in particular. Decrease the pace if the athlete loses form or break the session into manageable sets e.g. 1500m 3:41.49, mile 4:01.9, 3000m 8:03.12.

For example, is clear to everybody that, if i�m able to run (a) 3 times 800m in 1�52 with 6� recovery, and i run 1500m in 3�35, the day i�m. Steve ovett once did this workout.</p>
