</center> <p><strong>Shoulder Workout After Chest Day</strong>, The simple reason is that on back and bicep day you have used the flexor muscles (involved in pulling) and on chest and shoulder or triceps day you would be using the extensor muscles (involved in pushing). If the load is higher than you can load up with bodyweight exercises (the real reason why people should lift weights), then forget it.</p>

<p>Be sure to go all the way up and down, and not to ‘cheat’ your movements. Warm set of 15 reps followed by sets of 10,8,6,4, reps. You can do it is your shoulders arent to sore, but a lot of chest workouts incorporate shoulder muscles. This is mainly because it’s unhealthy for your muscles to be overly stressed.</p>
<h3 id="perhaps-a-back-chest-rest-legs-arms-rest-shoulders-rest-would-allow-for-adequate-restrecovery-to-really-hammer-shoulders-if-you-feel-they-are-lagging">Perhaps a back, chest, rest, legs, arms, rest, shoulders, rest would allow for adequate rest/recovery to really hammer shoulders if you feel they are lagging.</h3><p>You can do it is your shoulders arent to sore, but a lot of chest workouts incorporate shoulder muscles. If the load is higher than you can load up with bodyweight exercises (the real reason why people should lift weights), then forget it. I didn�t like doing chest on the same day as shoulders because you are using a lot of the same. Chest (heavy) + shoulders (heavy) + abs. You can definitely train chest and shoulder muscles after back and bicep day. If your shoulders are sore following chest day at the gym, this could be a sign you’re doing something wrong.</p>
