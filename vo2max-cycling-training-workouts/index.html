<p>Now, the game has changed, and thankfully so. I’ve included a modified rønnestad workout in my own training plan for 2017 with some modifications: New vvo2max workouts lead to impressive gains in fitness.

<p>Warm up for 10minutes and then do 3 x 1minute fast pedaling drills. Track your weight, sleep, hours, fatigue and stress while you train.

<p>Hickson was doing three vo2max workouts a week on the bike, but most cyclists are likely hitting a race or group ride on the weekend.
