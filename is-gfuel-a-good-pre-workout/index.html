<p>And to fuel your workout, melissa has been enjoying g fuel as. Pre workouts aren’t really good for you in the first place, they keep you up at night have a billion stims in them and are just a smorgasbord of random ingredients with really weak links to beneficial results. What soda has the highest caffeine? Pre workout is good.</p>

<p>While caffeine can help, it needs to be taken in moderation as too much caffeine can cause ill effects during and after exercising. When it comes to cardio, melissa recommends splitting time between elliptical, bikes, and stairs, saying it’s best for weight loss and better for the joints when compared to running. Gfuel is just rebranded pre workout that is.</p>
