<p>If you really want to try an actual preworkout supplement, i�d recommend muscle pharm assault. Whether you think you can or can�t, your right. I was highly disappointed when i could no longer get hold of 2.0, and decided to give 3.0 a try on the back of this. It�s pretty good, it contains adaptogens like ginseng and rhodiola rosea,.</p>
