The chest and shoulder muscles are both used in many of the same compound movements such as the bench press or military press.</p>
<h3 id="my-general-rule-of-thumb-when-resting-between-workouts-is-48-hours-for-small-muscles-such-as-biceps-triceps-calves">My general rule of thumb when resting between workouts is 48 hours for small muscles such as biceps, triceps, calves.</h3><p>Now, if you are only going to train each muscle group once per week with a split like this (or any similar split), you need to ensure that you provide enough of a training stimulus during that 1 weekly workout to actually warrant not training each muscle.
