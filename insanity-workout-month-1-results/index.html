<p>Month 2 month 2 was much more intense than month 1 and much heavier on the upper body moves. If you stick to healthy eating and perform all the workouts you will be fitter and slimmer and more toned at the end of 60 days. That means insanity is a pretty far cry from your everyday workout routine. For me insanity has really kick started my fitness goals over the last few years.</p>
<h3 id="starting-in-the-second-month-it-goes-from-insanity-to-max-insanity">Starting in the second month it goes from insanity to max insanity.</h3><p>If you stick to healthy eating and perform all the workouts you will be fitter and slimmer and more toned at the end of 60 days. But first you need to get to that recovery week to heal your body and break through any plateaus. The nice thing too is during the first month, the workouts are only 40 minutes so you can get in and get out fast with rapid results.” “insanity will get you the six pack if you are a little more careful about what you eat. The workouts increase to about 60 minutes each. I had been sitting at that weight since october 2011. Month 1 review insanity recovery week &amp; month 2 day 1 insanity:</p>

<p>This was the most difficult workout for me during month 1, but you will definitely notice substantial improvement from week to week. Month 1 has its own list of workouts that you alternate between each week, while month 2 has similar yet more difficult versions of those same workouts. The nice thing too is during the first month, the workouts.</p>
