<p>It�s possible to follow along and still get a workout, but ting�s form is questionable and she doesn�t explain the techniques, potentially making them less effective. My home routine consisted of exercising for a minimum of 3 hours a day, 6 times a week with the following: Check out my recipes for weight loss meal ideas, with lots of options.</p>

<p>Yes, i watched these videos while lying on the sofa and snacking on a bag of chips. While there may be many other reasons why you feel like it is that way, exercising constantly at higher intensity can cause inflammation in the body. Chloe does have a disclaimer stating that the programme won’t necessarily make you lose weight as everyone’s.</p>

<p>Chloe ting definitely kicked it up a notch this week and introduced some of the harder videos. And i, like many other viewers, belonged to the “passive audience” community. I want to start her summer shred 2019 program soon, although i hope it won�t be too much because my fitness level is quite low i�d say 😂 but i�m curious.</p>

<p>Everyone knows (if they dont, they should) that exercise is supplementary to an appropriate diet for weight loss. It also included a couple of active rest days for you to take off or enjoy something like a walk or yoga. Before you even watch the video, please know that i think this program is pretty fantastic and could use some.</p>
