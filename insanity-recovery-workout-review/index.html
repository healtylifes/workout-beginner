<p>The main month will have five arrangements of intense workouts, a fitness test, plyometric cardio circuit, intense cardio and resistance preparing, cardio recovery and only cardio. Filled to the brim with exercises like planks and extensions; However, let me be very clear about something: Today i’m reviewing the insanity cardio recovery workout. You get thirty second water breaks between each.</p>

<p>What makes insanity timeless has less to do with production values and more with the sheer intensity of the whole program. The initial 30 days of insanity exercises are exceptionally extreme.

<p>You get thirty second water breaks between each set, and the main workout, while pretty brutal, spreads the exercises evenly between lower and upper body, so no one area gets taxed unduly….
