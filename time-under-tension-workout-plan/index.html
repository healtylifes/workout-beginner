Tempo Training Method Time Under Tension Improve Your From pinterest.com</p>
<p>Using a leg exercise in which balance is not a factor is the best resource for this training method. One of the things athletes may have a hard time understanding is slowing down. A consistently high quality training output will, over time, give you the gains you desire. Time under tension training was something i looked at over a decade ago after college.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-set-can-provide-more-time-under-tension-than-the-latter">The first set can provide more time under tension than the latter.</h3><p>Focus on timing your sets instead of simply doing lots. With the right plan and the right discipline, you can get seriously shredded in just 28 days. The traditional time under tension concept is based on four seconds lowering your weight, 1 second pause, and 2 seconds to raise your weight. It was influenced by some of the work by charles staley as well as dave tate. Say you perform six reps with a slow tempo and 12 reps at a faster tempo. An absolute must for anyone working with weights, especially for older folk, is to do a series of stretching exercises as a warm up.</p>
