<p>Eat within 2 hours after your workout. The process of protein synthesis and repair is enhanced when the body has more protein post workout. I tried protein shakes, and even once made the mistake of eating a whole plate of pasta an hour before lifting (bad idea). Grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. Only time protein shakes are good are before.</p>

<p>I was completely ignorant of the intricacies of carbohydrate and protein metabolism, but tuna and green beans turned out to be an effective system. Grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. Make a smoothie and add a scoop of protein to that. I usually eat a can after the workout with about 6 crackers. If you want to just down a can.</p>

<p>Real food is always better for you than shakes or supplements (see any of michael pollan�s work). Other options that will help provide both carbs and protein include trail mix with nuts and dried fruit or peanut butter on crackers. It’s cool and refreshing and will hit the spot after a hot and sweaty workout. All about how to eat.</p>

<p>Tuna, jacket potato, and salad is a great post workout meal. And honestly, it doesn’t even have to be a shake. If you want to just down a can of tuna and then eat a meal later do that. Grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. The protein shakes will get digested very quickly and won�t put the protein to good use.</p>
