2 Haftada Karın Kası Chloe Ting Abs Workout Challenge From youtube.com</p>
<p>Like the psychopath i am, i decided to do this workout in the morning before going to work. Ting�s other claim to fame is helping people achieve 11 line abs, a specific aesthetic wherein the stomach muscles are defined to form visible, parallel lines along the midriff. However, you may find her workouts a little slow or simple if you are at an intermediate or advanced level. Ting sculpts her workout videos to target the whole body, rather than just focusing on one part of the body.</p>
