The hill workout is nothing more than an exercise that mimics walking real hills. Each hill gets progressively steeper until you take a quarter mile recovery and then start climbing all over. This workout is conservative, as all initial training sessions of a particular type should be, but over time you can progress to five to seven work intervals, with slightly shortened recoveries. Ideally a good 10 minutes including 5 minutes of easy running followed by some gradual accelerations. Not only will you get a great cardiovascular workout but the hills will build strength and power in your legs and glutes.</p>
