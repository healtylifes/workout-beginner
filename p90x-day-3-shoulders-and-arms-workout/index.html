<p>Due to a relatives birthday, i didn�t get to workout until 11pm tonight, but it didn�t bother me because i felt that if i missed a day, or skipped a day in the sequence that i was letting myself down. Each section has three exercises, each repeated once. Okay, so the shoulders and arms routine was good. Awesome, 3 days.</p>
