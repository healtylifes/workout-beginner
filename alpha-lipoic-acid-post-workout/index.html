<h3 id="ala-increases-the-uptake-of-many-nutrients-and-supplements-specifically-creatine">Ala increases the uptake of many nutrients and supplements, specifically creatine.</h3><p>It is also a natural antioxidant with free radical scavenging abilities as well as the ability to regenerate oxidized antioxidants. Ala’s major role is to support the function of enzymes in the mitochondria—the structures which generate cellular energy. Ala helps prevent or repair muscle damage in both endurance and resistance exercise. Taking alpha lipoic acid before a workout to increase ampk and hope for increases in fatty acid oxidation is only going to increase your risk of going hypoglycemic (with all its recently discussed potentially obesogenic negative side effects). However, information from intervention studies investigating physiological effects of an ala in athletes after exercise is. Endurance athletes pump higher amounts of oxygen through their respiratory systems during exercise compared to the resting condition.</p>
