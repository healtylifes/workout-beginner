<p>As such, don�t train chest right after triceps or biceps directly after back. Triceps, biceps, chest, back, thighs, shoulders, and finally, calves. 7x in 2 weeks = 3.5 times a week, genius. But if you’ve got time, there’s no reason why you can’t throw in some direct arm work at the end of each workout. When you pair up body.</p>

<p>The idea behind a 5 day split is that you dedicate each of the 5. You also vary your reps from workout to workout. My 5x5 routine consists of (you guessed it) five workouts.
