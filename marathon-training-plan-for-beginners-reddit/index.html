<p>Marathon training plans and tips for both beginners and advanced runners. Choose an a race (the race you want to do your best in to culminate your cycle) and put it at the end of the cycle and train your ass off! In a race the best time to walk is entering a drinks station, that way you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running. Felt fine but was getting kind of dizzy.</p>
<h3 id="otherwise-you-should-take-time-to-do-so">Otherwise you should take time to do so.</h3><p>You can walk during training runs too. My training has been the typical 2 speed work sessions per week, typically 8x400s, sometimes 4x800s, and some type of tempo run, or sometimes just more 400s because i�m so darn slow these days. The training plan is for you if it’s the first time you’ve run a marathon, or a long time since you ran any longer distances. Recommended starting mileage is deceptively low and probably not a good idea for newer runners to the marathon and structured training. Gradually this will build to 75% of whr as you start to practice periods of marathon or race pace running. Your marathon experience will be much more enjoyable if you start at a pace you can sustain the whole way.</p>
