<p>For every mile ifit members ran, walked, or cycled, we pledged to donate $1 to tommy and his family.

Tommy rivers has won or was a top finisher in.</p>

<p>I do this not only on race day, but after everyrun or workout, every day of the week. So, i searched the ifit online catalog and found a 6 week beginning running program with ifit trainer, tommy rivers puzey. What was intriguing to me is that many of the messages that he shared over and over throughout the 6 week.</p>

<p>Confident he could contend for the win, rivers spent six months training for the event only to have his ass handed to him, finishing 45 minutes behind the winner in 24 th place. While i understand this is by design and meant to induce a cumulative amount of fatigue over the course of a week, i do enjoy really pushing.</p>
