<p>I�m assuming since i bought it from gnc that they wouldn�t carry any sketchy pre workouts. Woke af ™ is not for beginners, rookies, or people who curl in the squat rack.

<p>I don�t know how to attach images. The best pre workout for men overall would be nitraflex, due to the testosterone boosting ingredients.
