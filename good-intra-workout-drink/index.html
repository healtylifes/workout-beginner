You can simply have glucose water/ fruit juice/ or a carb supplement along with amino acids during workout for better results. These branch chain amino acids are three of the most important aminos in this drink. I myself prefer gatorade with a fast absorbing whey protein isolate (always vanilla). Purple wraath offers one of the best intra workout drinks in the market. Ionic+ drive™ can be used as a hypotonic (before) or isotonic (during) drink.</p>
