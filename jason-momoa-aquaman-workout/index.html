<p>Your off days could be complete rest, or light activity. It’s important to mention that this isn’t the exact routine that jason momoa has followed. Including the front, side, and back. Building round, fully developed delts is a challenge for natural lifters. Well, we went and got it straight from khal drogo’s horse’s mouth.</p>

<p>Aku—also known as skipjack tuna—is said to be a personal favourite. This is not the official jason momoa workout. But adding dumbbells to this exercise…jason momoa, you savage. The workout below is just a sample of one workout that momoa would do when training for the role of aquaman. Simply start with 7 sets of 7 reps with 7 seconds.</p>

When asked about his aquaman workout routine, jason momoa says: Unless you already look pretty fucking great, the exact routine jason did for aquaman isn’t going to work for you..</p>

Simply start with 7 sets of 7 reps with 7 seconds of rest between each set for a predetermined circuit of exercises.
