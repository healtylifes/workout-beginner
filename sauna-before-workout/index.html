<p>Using a sauna after workout helps to relax the body and muscles and to gradually lower the heart rate to healthy levels. You can reap the benefits of sauna bathing anytime. The main benefit is that saunas allow your body to warm up before actually working out. On the other hand, if you have muscles or joints that are prone to muscle strain or injury, you should be visiting the sauna after the workout.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-other-hand-it-is-believed-that-sauna-before-a-workout-can-risk-muscle-injuries-and-serious-dehydration">On the other hand, it is believed that sauna before a workout can risk muscle injuries and serious dehydration.</h3><p>While there are few instances when a sit in the sauna won’t feel good, you’ll get the most benefit from using the sauna prior to your workout. After, you’ll increase your overall athletic endurance. If you start to break a sweat, you’ve been in too long. But while some people like to pregame their workout by warming up their muscles in a sauna—which helps you loosen up, but shouldn’t replace your regular warm up—using the sauna after you exercise, when you’re still a little dehydrated, may be even better. Spending a few minutes in the sauna before your workout is a better idea, he says, and may indeed help you feel warmed up and relieve some immediate muscle pain. Overall, for healthy people, both strategies should be completely safe and good to practice.</p>
