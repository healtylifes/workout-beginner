<p>Sudafed make your heart pump faster, increase your blood pressure and make you nervous. Was thinking of doubling the sudafed to 120mg and doing it about 2 hours prior to workout. 10 yet, despite coinciding their subjects’ 40 km cycling time trial with the peak plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations, there was still no improvement in exercise performance. Your pre workout does as well most likely.</p>
