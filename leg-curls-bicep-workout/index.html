<p>Performing curls with your leg is one of the most convenient weightless bicep exercises that you can do to build muscle because you don�t need any equipment. I see many women doing a lot of curls quickly then moving on to other exercises. The regular body drag curl was a favorite of the late, great vince gironda for targeting the biceps. But a lot of women don’t realize the basics behind.</p>
<h3 id="to-make-the-exercise-easier-you-can-use-your-leg-to-assist-the-movement-while-to-make-it-harder-you-can-use-your-leg-to-resist">To make the exercise easier you can use your leg to assist the movement, while to make it harder you can use your leg to resist.</h3><p>One of the best big exercises for biceps is the barbell cheat curl because the ‘cheat’ during the concentric portion of this curling exercise allows us to create great eccentric overload. Keep your shoulders down, back straight, and elbows glued to your sides. All you need is your lower leg and a spare 5 minutes. But a lot of women don’t realize the basics behind. Sometimes we just don’t have access to equipment but that’s not an issue with the bicep leg curl as you only need your arms and legs (you’ve probably guessed them by now) to get an effective workout. Your arms should be on the floor out to the side.</p>
