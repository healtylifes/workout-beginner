This will help your ability to contract your muscles faster and be ready for the main part of the session. After eight weeks of lactate threshold work (two cycles of three weeks of lt training twice a week, then one week easy, as just described), spend at least a month riding steadily at about 30 beats below lt to build your endurance. These sample workouts will help you to start planning your next threshold training block:</p>

If you are a relatively new athlete that has not yet reached your metabolic limits, you can use threshold workouts to move lactate threshold to a greater percentage of vo2 max; Lactate threshold is the glass ceiling of cycling performance—it�s an invisible barrier that keeps you down.

Working on the lactate threshold is especially important for cyclists focusing on shorter races where it is important to sustain high intensity for extended periods of time..</p>
